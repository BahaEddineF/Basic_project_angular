# Basic Project Angular

This is a basic Angular project designed to help you learn and practice fundamental Angular concepts such as `ngFor`, `ngIf`, `ngStyle`, forms (Reactive and Template-driven), and data binding. The project also includes examples and demonstrations of these concepts.
## Features
